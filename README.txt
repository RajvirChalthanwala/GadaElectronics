Hello! I am going to make new web application named "GadaElectronics"
which I commited to the git repository by the time and I run the application after
building it and everything is good so far... :)

8:21PM 
Good Evening, As in continue, I added the Model section and created TonyTv.cs file
and added the content in it using the file provided
I added my useful properties which are:
"Id", "Brand", "OriginCountry", "Price", "Size", "SerialNumber" and "DiaplayClearity"....
Rebuild the program...
No errors so far Good newsssssszzzzz.... :)
Comitted to git repos..
and sucessfully saved the content untill now.

Again as per the steps created the Data folder to store our database context
and altered the data as per my names of the application and..
saved the program.....
Rebuild it and run it again...
Comitted to github repo....
Sucessfully :)
Very happy!!!!!!!
No errors so far..

As per the steps mentioned below I commented out the SSHL Port
in order to use any of the server which was created..
updated the startup.cs file and the appconfuigurations.json
as per requirement ////

I again updated the line 31 present in the Startup.cs file 
which was about the SqlServer :)
Now it was very important to save it again as per Andrew Stelle....
It is important to save the file and commit it at the same time to avoid 
bunch of errors...
